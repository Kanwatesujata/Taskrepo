#Write a Python program to calculate the area of a circle given its radius using the formula area=π×r^2 ( Take pie as 3.14)

# π = 3.14
# r = float(input ("Radius of circle"))
#
# print (r)
#
# area_of_cirle = π * r * 2
# print (area_of_cirle);

#Create a program that takes two numbers as input and prints whether the first number is greater than, less than, or equal to the second number

num1 = int(input("Enter first number "))

print(num2)
# if (num1>=num2):
#     print("num1 is greater",num1)
